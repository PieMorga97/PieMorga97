Since I was a teenager my family and I have been in a close relationship with the oriental world, for we lived in Shanghai for several years. I attended and Chinese school with Chinese students, I immediately began to experience Chinese culture and people's habits. This chapter of my life influenced also my character: I am polite, social, outgoing, hardworking, and also a very sportive person I practice a lot of different sports.
